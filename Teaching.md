  <a style = "font-size:12pt">"Professor Seregina is a great instructor! Her lectures were very interesting and her way of teaching the course made it easy to understand concepts that I had seen in other classes that I didn't fully understand. I appreciate our Professor's efforts in holding live zoom lectures as well  as recordings of the lectures to accommodate students during this global pandemic. Professor Seregina provided as all the resources needed to pass her course and there were never any difficulty's with holding lectures. I think that out of all the instructors I had these past two quarters, Professor Seregina was the most prepared and flexible instructor during this pandemic. Professor Seregina is a great instructor and it is evident that she is passionate and dedicated to teaching!"</a><br/>
  <a style = "font-size:12pt">"By far one of the best “professors” i have had if not the best. Complex problems are simplified and she leaves room for students to ask questions. Not only does she prepare us in the classroom but she assists us in preparing for real-life scenarios. In addition, the slides provided are easy to understand and she is extremely flexible in her teaching which makes her a great professor. When a student puts in effort into her homework and attends her lectures then they are rewarded with a higher grade. Simple as that."</a><br/>
  <a style = "font-size:12pt">"I thoroughly enjoyed taking this class. Thank you for doing your best to accommodating towards students especially during this weird time as of now."</a><br/>
  <a style = "font-size:12pt">"Professor Seregina has been very helpful throughout this pandemic. Above all else this class was organized efficiently and the material reviewed gave insight to real world problems. Homework was constructed based on the material gone over in lecture so there was never a time the lecture slides didn't have the answers. Even with the method to turn in test made it as stress-free as possible, she allowed us to either turn it in through ilearn but since difficulties arise we were allowed to email our responses. Overall this class was a very insightful class and i would definitely take another class taught by this professor."</a><br/>
  <a style = "font-size:12pt">"I like how that the professor give detailed examples of the concepts we learned. I also liked how she presents the lessons through power points and post them. I also appreciate how she records the lessons and post them so I can watch them again."</a><br/>
  <a style = "font-size:12pt">"This teacher was very helpful and responded to questions immediately. Strongly recommend taking her class."</a><br/>
  <a style = "font-size:12pt">"Great lectures. some really good information i have learned."</a><br/>
